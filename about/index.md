#Introduction

Hi there, my nickname is Gnufabio. I'm a 20-years-old Italian developer. I'm currently attending Automation Engineering at [Politecnico di Milano](http://www.polimi.it).

#My Informatic experience
I've started to play with my computers at the age of 12. At that time, I was using a Pentium III desktop powered by Windows XP. 
Then, I bought an Acer Aspire 5920G, on which I suddently installed Ubuntu alongside Windows 7.

At the moment, I own an HP Sleekbook 15-b045el, but I plan to assembly my own desktop computer. But I will talk about that in the next posts.

I've started to program at the age of 13, with Python. However, I've never really programmed in Python, since I've studied Java, which i currently use to create Android Applications.

Actually, I love C. It's powerful, elegrant and fast. I'd like to study it at a lower level.
